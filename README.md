This repository is a fork of [GMAP/NPB-GPU](https://github.com/GMAP/NPB-GPU), that provided GPU-appropriate version of the NAS Parallel Benchmarks ([NPB](https://www.nas.nasa.gov/software/npb.html)) using CUDA.

# NAS Parallel Benchmarks for GPU using CUDA Graphs
This project is a part of the work done for the article that sets out to compare performance of CUDA and CUDA Graphs, taking [GMAP/NPB-GPU](https://github.com/GMAP/NPB-GPU) project as reference work. Within the `CUDA` directory one can find the details regarding CUDA Graphs implementation.
